# Proof of Concept: WebStorm's file and code template for NestJS

## Notes

- Simple way to create NestJS file is create NestJS file by type. for example, 
  Create file with NestJS Service File's menu and type service's name.
  - When you create a NestJS service file then have a popup asking what your file name is that 
    does not make sense.
